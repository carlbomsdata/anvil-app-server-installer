## ‚öôÔ∏è Behind the Scenes

Here‚Äôs a general overview of what happens when the provided scripts are executed:

### `install.bat`

- **Creates a log directory**: Ensures logs are stored in `C:\AnvilAppServer\log` for debugging and monitoring purposes.
- **Checks for an existing service**: If the Anvil App Server service (`AnvilAppService`) already exists, it stops and removes the service to avoid conflicts.
- **Registers a new service**: Uses `nssm.exe` to create a Windows service called `AnvilAppService`, configured to run as the non-admin user `anvil-user`.
- **Sets up logging**: Configures the service to log all output (both `stdout` and `stderr`) to a single log file.
- **Starts the service**: Ensures the service is up and running after setup.

### `run.bat`

- **Sets up a Python environment**:
  - Checks for an existing virtual environment. If it doesn‚Äôt exist, it creates one.
  - Activates the virtual environment and upgrades `pip` to the latest version.
- **Installs the Anvil App Server**: Downloads and installs the `anvil-app-server` Python package into the virtual environment.
- **Configures SSL certificates**: Points the `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variable to the appropriate certificate file for secure connections.
- **Starts the Anvil App Server**: Launches the server, using a placeholder for the project name that you replace with your actual project.
